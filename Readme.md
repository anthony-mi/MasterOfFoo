===========

An experiment in using `printf` style strings in more places.

The code is essentially a broken up version of [`printf.fs`](https://github.com/fsharp/fsharp/blob/master/src/fsharp/FSharp.Core/printf.fs) so the license will be the same (Apache 2.0) but most of the bugs are mine.

Everything, the name, the code, this readme, whatever is **⚠️⚠️⚠️ COMPLETELTY EXPERIMENTAL ⚠️⚠️⚠️** (For now).

Don't depend on it, or look at it too long it might move or disappear without warning 🔥🔥🔥.
